1.)Given a string say "abcdef" all the characters need to be replaced by their reflections . Like a is replaced with z , b with y etc. The input string is guaranteed to have all lowercase characters.

	Sample Input:
	abcd
	
	Output:
	zyxw
		







2.)Write a program to find minimum number of elements to be removed from an array to make that array in non decreasing.

Sample Input1:

4

1 2 3 1

output:

1



Sample Input1:

7

3 2 6 4 5 1 7 

output:

3




3.)Write a program to determine that task will be assigned to which employee in a 2D matrix of two employees  such that the answer should be unique and quality of task should be maximized.

for example     2 3
                          4 3
               First row represents the skill of the first employee in first & second task.        
       Second row represents the skill of the second employee in first & second task.

In the first task both the employees have the same skill but in  the second task the second employee skill is better than first.
So,answer would be (2,1).

                      3 2
                      2 2
           In this case the answer would be (1,2)






4.) Given a number we need to find the number of times its digits need to be added so it becomes a single digit number .

    Example 91=9+1=10
	    10=1+0=1

                  So two times.

	Sample Input
		91
		output
		2



5. Given the current page of a book say 23 and the number of digits that a printer can print say 2 . Determine the last digit the printer can print .

    In this case after printing the next number from 23 ie 24 the printer runs out of ink since it had only enough to print 2 characters . So output= 24.




	Input 
		First line will contain the current page number.
		Second line will conatin the more number of digits that printer can print.
	Output
		Last page number that will ne printed.


	Sample Input:
		21
		5
	output
		23


6.) Input is two integers n and d. And then an array of size d.  n is the number of houses in a town arranged in a circular manner. Moving between each house takes one minute.

     Now say n=4 , so the houses are 1,2,3,4. If d=4 and the input array is 1 3 2 4 , the output needs to be the minimum time it needs to travel from house 1 to 3  to 2 and then to 4.

    Also no matter what the input array , we need to start travelling from house 1. So if the array is 3 2 1 4 . The time from house 1 to 3 also needs to be added . Also since the houses are in a circular order , travel in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions is possible.
