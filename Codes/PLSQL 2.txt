You have a row level BEFORE UPDATE trigger on the EMP table. This trigger contains a SELECT statement on the EMP table to ensure that the new salary value falls within the minimum and maximum salary for a given job title. What happens when you try to update a salary value in the EMP table?
	
The trigger fails because you cannot use the minimum and maximum functions in a BEFORE UPDATE trigger. 
	
The trigger fires successfully. 
	
The trigger fails because a SELECT statement on the table being updated is not allowed. 
	
The trigger fails because it needs to be a row level AFTER UPDATE trigger.
